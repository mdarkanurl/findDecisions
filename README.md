Decision Log API is a backend service built with NestJS that records why important actions happened in a system. Instead of only tracking actions, it stores structured, immutable decision records including who made the decision (user, admin, or system), the reason behind it, supporting context, and the final outcome.
The service is designed for auditability, debugging, and transparency in real-world applications such as moderation, automated rules, and business workflows.
